    <h2>About ChimeraGPT</h2>
    <section id="about">
        <p>Well, the ChimeraGPT is an api maintained by Guest (cool_guestyy) on May 20, 2023. The co-ceo of it is Genife (genife). We maintained it with one mind in our heads: Make a service, where users can use GPT-4 for free.</p>
        <p>How did you get GPT-4? Well, we got it through reverse engineering <a href="https://poe.com/">Poe</a>. We got the tokens for it, through this discord server (<a href="https://discord.gg/eStXUJEZn4">Discord Link</a>).</p>
        <p>We are keeping it even today!</p>

    <h2>History of ChimeraGPT</h2>
    <section id="history">
        <p>As we told ya, we're created this service for GPT-4. On May 20, the project was opened publicly. The problem was in hosting and any other things.</p>
        <p>Luckily, Genife gave me everything of that. And I made him co-ceo. The date was 21 May, 2023.</p>
        <p>Genife fell for a free org, familiar as "weeeeeeee", maintained by discodtehe. We fell for it, and then... News blew up about ChimeraGPT, even <a href="https://vice.com">Vice</a> wrote an article about ChimeraGPT. We were in a shock state...</p>
        <p>But after, the hate is gone...</p>
